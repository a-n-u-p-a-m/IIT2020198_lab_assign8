In question 1 we declare a 2-D array and populate it with user inputs. Then we find the transpose of the 2-D array and print both the original matrix and its transpose.

In question 2 we store random values in a 24 element 1-D int array. We use these values to populate a 2-D array with 4 rows and 6 columns. At last we print the 2-D array in matrix form.

In question 3 we populate a 3x3 matrix with user inputs. Then we check the diagonal elements if they are 1 and the non-diagonal elements if they are 0. The position of elements which satisfy the conditions is printed as row no.,column no.
